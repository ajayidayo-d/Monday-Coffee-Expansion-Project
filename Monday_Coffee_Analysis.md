## üßÆ SQL Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Coffee Consumers Count
```sql
SELECT 
   city_name,
   ROUND((population * 0.25)/1000000,2) AS coffee_consumers_in_millions,
   city_rank
FROM city
ORDER BY population DESC;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue from Coffee Sales (Q4 2023)
```sql
SELECT 
    ci.city_name,
    SUM(s.total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales AS s
JOIN customers AS c
    ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN city AS ci
    ON c.city_id = ci.city_id
WHERE YEAR(s.sale_date) = 2023
  AND DATEPART(QUARTER, s.sale_date) = 4
GROUP BY ci.city_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Count per Product
```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    COUNT(s.sale_id) AS total_orders
FROM products AS p
LEFT JOIN sales AS s
    ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY COUNT(s.sale_id) DESC;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Average Sales per Customer by City
```sql
SELECT
    ci.city_name,
    SUM(s.total) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS total_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(s.total)/COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id), 2) AS [Avg_Sales_per_city]
FROM sales AS s
JOIN customers AS c
    ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN city AS ci
    ON c.city_id = ci.city_id
GROUP BY ci.city_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ City Population and Coffee Consumers
```sql
WITH city_table AS (
    SELECT 
        city_name,
        ROUND((population * 0.25) / 1000000, 2) AS coffee_consumers
    FROM city
),
customers_table AS (
    SELECT 
        ci.city_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS unique_customers
    FROM sales AS s
    JOIN customers AS c
        ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
    JOIN city AS ci
        ON c.city_id = ci.city_id
    GROUP BY ci.city_name
)
SELECT 
    ct.city_name,
    ct.coffee_consumers,
    cu.unique_customers
FROM city_table AS ct
JOIN customers_table AS cu
    ON ct.city_name = cu.city_name;
```
