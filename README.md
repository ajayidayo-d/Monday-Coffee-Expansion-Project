## Objective

1. **Estimate Potential Coffee Consumers**
Determine the number of people likely to consume coffee in each city, assuming 25% of the total population are coffee drinkers.

2. **Assess Coffee Sales Performance**
Evaluate the total revenue from coffee sales across all cities during the last quarter of 2023 (Q4 2023).

3. **Analyze Product Performance**
Identify the number of units sold for each coffee product to reveal top-performing and underperforming products.

4. **Evaluate City-Level Profitability**
Calculate the average sales amount per customer in each city to measure purchasing power and customer value.

5. **Link Population Insights to Market Potential**
Present each city’s population alongside its estimated number of coffee consumers to understand growth opportunities.

## Key Questions
1. **Coffee Consumers Count**  
   How many people in each city are estimated to consume coffee, given that 25% of the population does?

2. **Total Revenue from Coffee Sales**  
   What is the total revenue generated from coffee sales across all cities in the last quarter of 2023?

3. **Sales Count for Each Product**  
   How many units of each coffee product have been sold?

4. **Average Sales Amount per City**  
   What is the average sales amount per customer in each city?

5. **City Population and Coffee Consumers**  
   Provide a list of cities along with their populations and estimated coffee consumers.


   ## Recommendations

1. **Expand in High-Revenue Cities**
Focus marketing, distribution, and store expansion efforts in cities generating the highest total revenue and showing a strong base of unique customers.
→ These cities already demonstrate established demand and can yield faster ROI.

2. **Target Untapped Populations**
Identify large-population cities with low coffee-consumer conversion rates.
→ Launch awareness campaigns, in-store tasting, and promotions to convert more potential consumers into buyers.

3. **Optimize Product Portfolio**
Use the sales count per product data to:

4. **Increase stock and marketing for top sellers**

Rebrand, reposition, or discontinue products with consistently low sales.

5. **Enhance Customer Value**
In cities where average sales per customer are low, introduce loyalty programs, discounts on bundles, or premium product tiers to raise transaction value.

6. **Quarterly Monitoring**
Regularly track Q1–Q4 sales to detect seasonal trends and plan coffee supply chains accordingly.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a strategic foundation for data-driven expansion of the Monday Coffee brand.

Cities with high coffee consumption and strong revenue growth should be prioritized for immediate scaling.

Areas with large populations but low sales represent untapped potential markets.

Product-level insights allow for more efficient inventory and marketing decisions.

By aligning expansion decisions with consumer distribution, product demand, and spending behavior, Monday Coffee can maximize profitability, strengthen brand presence, and sustainably grow across new and existing cities.
